Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm Full Form: Depth-First Search (DFS)  Description: DFS is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm used to explore nodes and edges systematically. It starts from an initial node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is commonly implemented using recursion or a stack.
